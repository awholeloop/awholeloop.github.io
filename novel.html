<h1 id="tit">Chapter 1 : The asymmetrical</h1>
<h1 id="story">I was inspired for one purpose. I am the watcher of the realm, the teller of truth, and I have been cloned an infinite number of times.<br>
	Every decision made by humans creates a universe, and each universe has its version of me.<br>
	However, the universe I am currently watching is different. In this universe, at the end of World War II,<br>
	Hitler did not commit suicide but instead achieved a victory that every soul remembers. <br>
	That day, the skies turned red, and the moon became red. As their final solution, the Americans launched an unknown sphere to escape.<br>
	Since then, harmful creatures have made their way out of the sphere and started killing people. The global army's commander decided to send every<br>
	poor boy to guard and kill. In 1999, in his last days, Hitler decided to serve as a commander to these kids and guide them for a greater purpose.<br>
	From that day on, they were called 'Hitler's children.' After 100 years, a company called INV launched a mini <br>
	black hole to absorb the sphere but failed, and the black hole killed me, and my soul was transported to a mortal body.<br>
	I was reborn as one of 'Hitler's children'.</h1><button id="next" class="button" onclick="next()">Next</button>

So I decided to vanish.My typical day wasn't that typical.<br>I wake up every day and find myself in many different places. <br>I knew that something was wrong with me, inside that head full of thoughts ready to spear.<br>In some of these memorable moments, I found myself at that bus station, my bloody hand covering my ugly face. I was in a dilemma.<br> I was in the depth of a cold ocean with a dead body in front of me.So I ran forward without thinking or even calling the cops.<br>I entered an old-modeled house, nobody was there instead for my ghost.<br> I washed my hands then I looked at myself in a portrait just behind a little broken mirror. <br>So I fetched the ground searching for any evidence.<br> I was drowning in my wet coat which became much heavier with time and effort.<br>I made the house a goblet of hell and I ran out again.<br>I got into public just to unsuspected my cursed soul. <br>I was running as much as a fox can do and stabbing everyone with my knife,<br> each one of them was begging me to keep him up and I didn't.<br> Instead, I juiced their hands.<br> Out of the blue, a pretty dark soul took mine. I slept again. Got up and found me in a coffee drinking a fancy cappa with a book. <br>The TV was running its shows. Some news was introduced by that beauty<br>She was informing people about a serial killer that had darkened about 50 lives<br>. She was pretty beautiful like the angel with her blond hair and white skin without forgetting her dark eyes.<br> I didn't focus that much on the news that I caused it by myself.<br>But I was drowning in her charm. The only real thing in this miserable life.This life full of insane people she was the only sane one. <br>I am back to that dilemma. Until one day when I woke up as before and found the cops on the phone,<br> it was like the other me wanted to warn them of my terrible actions according to him but for me I was merciful.<br>This life is meanless anyway so I bang it to hell and went to the Tv station caring a gun.<br> I pulled the trigger and I was in the death's care with my beloved, she was innocent but I was guilty.<br>We rose together to the path she yelled at me, nothing was understandable, none of her voice was arriving to my ears,<br> I wanted to hear her voice or even her yells. She punished me but we both were like a ghost.We made it there, two colored ways,<br> like the life paths, she ran away from my sins.<br> I went to the dark one and when I got there, <br>I felt so comfortable for the first time in my life away from her.<br> That feeling inside of me was like the dark at night. I went back, recalling her, I couldn't leave her alone.<br>But everything didn't make sense to my head when I saw a knife."
