<h1 id="tit">Chapter 1 : The asymmetrical</h1>
<h1 id="story">I was inspired for one purpose. I am the watcher of the realm, the teller of truth, and I have been cloned an infinite number of times.<br>
	Every decision made by humans creates a universe, and each universe has its version of me.<br>
	However, the universe I am currently watching is different. In this universe, at the end of World War II,<br>
	Hitler did not commit suicide but instead achieved a victory that every soul remembers. <br>
	That day, the skies turned red, and the moon became red. As their final solution, the Americans launched an unknown sphere to escape.<br>
	Since then, harmful creatures have made their way out of the sphere and started killing people. The global army's commander decided to send every<br>
	poor boy to guard and kill. In 1999, in his last days, Hitler decided to serve as a commander to these kids and guide them for a greater purpose.<br>
	From that day on, they were called 'Hitler's children.' After 100 years, a company called INV launched a mini <br>
	black hole to absorb the sphere but failed, and the black hole killed me, and my soul was transported to a mortal body.<br>
	I was reborn as one of 'Hitler's children'.</h1><button id="next" class="button" onclick="next()">Next</button>

You look like shit. Wake your ass up and start working.' So I did, and everyone stared at me as if I were from another universe, which was true. I ran to the sphere to check if the monsters were as big as they appeared. I saw one walking on the land, looking for meat, and a British voice yelled at me, 'Careful, mate!' He was quite big, about twice the size of an adult. A mere whisper shaded me, and it moved me to safety. I found myself in a big castle, surrounded by technology and tools for experiments. It appeared that someone was aware of me, and a conversation had just launched between us.<br><br>'Where am I, and what is this place?' I asked.<br><br>'Hello!' a scary but intelligent voice said. 'I summoned you by the laws of physics, and I know who you are.'<br><br>I stayed still like a bottle of cement; my stomach expressed my fear.<br><br>'You're the 'watcher' and the teller of the truth. You've witnessed the evilness of human beings and the resulting massacres. I've got an offer for you. I can send you back to your dimension.'<br><br>'And what are you expecting from a poor kid?' I asked.<br><br>'Nothing. I just want to make you my heir by teaching you all the concepts of physics.'<br><br>'Why would I come back?'<br><br>'Well, it's inevitable because I'm sending you to space to achieve the mission. Given that I'm going to use magnet levitation to send you back to the dimension you came from.'<br><br>'So what?'<br><br>'Heee; William, William, give me my notepads,' the mysterious man said. The butler came carrying a huge book.<br><br>'Now I remember. Well, the magnet does lose about 1% of its energy per 100 years. So you've got 50,000 years,' he said, yelling for no reason.<br><br>'I will do it,' I said with the voice of a petit kid.<br><br>'I'm sure that your return will be way faster than that period because even an unresponsive creature can feel the devil's presence in the spirit of mankind ruining it. Their purest ain't pure. They're pretenders. They're fond of one thing, and it's called 'Harm'. May eternity dissipate us before we do. Son, you are a shepherd among sheep, and one day you'll be our eternity and our salvation. That's why you shall be sent away from our sins.'<br><br>I stood when I heard these words. They were tough even for me. 'Who's he? Is he even human?' I wondered.<br><br>William took the measurements for my safety and put me on that ship, and it launched. After hours of traveling away from any object that may affect space-time, the magnet started working. For a moment, I felt at home, but it was like something took my place, and I teleported back to Earth with a scar on my face. I turned around, searching for the doctor, but everything was a mess. When I went to the sound source, I saw the unseen, and everything changed for the worse, as if my soul wasn't mine anymore.";
