<h1 id="tit">Chapter 1 : Darkness</h1>
<h1 id="story">You can see me every day and shake my hand and even think our lifestyles are similar but simply they are not.<br>
Entering that room, every single object was black, I spoke, <br>I sang, then I saw something pretty dark was moving there, I turned to ask the questions so anxious,<br> He was quite small but he emerged this new feeling inside my foggy head. I yelled at him "Save us!".<br>
No answer was coming from him then he got vanished in front of my eyes.<br>
Opening the light was a mistake because It got darker than before.<br>
He logged into my mind. He was playing me, my shitty mind, he was laughing at me<br>. Then he controlled it but very quickly quit,<br> It seemed that he didn't even like it, my material body made him uncomfortable. His answer was simply "Humans not to save".<br>
I had no choice, I walked forward searching for hope, completly pathetic looking for the light, <br>and found it. <br>A small room filled with whiteness and that cursed chair.<br> I sat, and he came to me the same creature, I yelled again and again "Save us" so I was murdered but in peace,<br> the blood was everywhere around my cold body, and my soul was rising and thanking him for saving mankind.<br> I went back to my bloody body, ran forward, again and again, <br>a lot of thoughts just came to me but I couldn't even think about it for a bit, I ignored them and then stopped,<br> I was standing in front of a typical human.<br>
As before, I yelled, "Save us!!".<br>He sat with no words to say, my legs were turning into fire, and I changed my words to "Save me fucking ass"<br>
He looked at me again while I was suffering and dying.<br>
He proved something another stupid human nature.</h1>
