<h1 id="tit">Chapter 1 : Darkness</h1>
<h1 id="story">You can see me every day and shake my hand and even think our lifestyles are similar but simply they are not.<br>
Entering that room, every single object was black, I spoke, <br>I sang, then I saw something pretty dark was moving there, I turned to ask the questions so anxious,<br> He was quite small but he emerged this new feeling inside my foggy head. I yelled at him "Save us!".<br>
No answer was coming from him then he got vanished in front of my eyes.<br>
Opening the light was a mistake because It got darker than before.<br>
He logged into my mind. He was playing me, my shitty mind, he was laughing at me<br>. Then he controlled it but very quickly quit,<br> It seemed that he didn't even like it, my material body made him uncomfortable. His answer was simply "Humans not to save".<br>
I had no choice, I walked forward searching for hope, completly pathetic looking for the light, <br>and found it. <br>A small room filled with whiteness and that cursed chair.<br> I sat, and he came to me the same creature, I yelled again and again "Save us" so I was murdered but in peace,<br> the blood was everywhere around my cold body, and my soul was rising and thanking him for saving mankind.<br> I went back to my bloody body, ran forward, again and again, <br>a lot of thoughts just came to me but I couldn't even think about it for a bit, I ignored them and then stopped,<br> I was standing in front of a typical human.<br>
As before, I yelled, "Save us!!".<br>He sat with no words to say, my legs were turning into fire, and I changed my words to "Save me fucking ass"<br>
He looked at me again while I was suffering and dying.<br>
He proved something another stupid human nature.</h1><button id="next" class="button" onclick="next()">Next</button>

So I decided to vanish.My typical day wasn't that typical.<br>I wake up every day and find myself in many different places. <br>I knew that something was wrong with me, inside that head full of thoughts ready to spear.<br>In some of these memorable moments, I found myself at that bus station, my bloody hand covering my ugly face. I was in a dilemma.<br> I was in the depth of a cold ocean with a dead body in front of me.So I ran forward without thinking or even calling the cops.<br>I entered an old-modeled house, nobody was there instead for my ghost.<br> I washed my hands then I looked at myself in a portrait just behind a little broken mirror. <br>So I fetched the ground searching for any evidence.<br> I was drowning in my wet coat which became much heavier with time and effort.<br>I made the house a goblet of hell and I ran out again.<br>I got into public just to unsuspected my cursed soul. <br>I was running as much as a fox can do and stabbing everyone with my knife,<br> each one of them was begging me to keep him up and I didn't.<br> Instead, I juiced their hands.<br> Out of the blue, a pretty dark soul took mine. I slept again. Got up and found me in a coffee drinking a fancy cappa with a book. <br>The TV was running its shows. Some news was introduced by that beauty<br>She was informing people about a serial killer that had darkened about 50 lives<br>. She was pretty beautiful like the angel with her blond hair and white skin without forgetting her dark eyes.<br> I didn't focus that much on the news that I caused it by myself.<br>But I was drowning in her charm. The only real thing in this miserable life.This life full of insane people she was the only sane one. <br>I am back to that dilemma. Until one day when I woke up as before and found the cops on the phone,<br> it was like the other me wanted to warn them of my terrible actions according to him but for me I was merciful.<br>This life is meanless anyway so I bang it to hell and went to the Tv station caring a gun.<br> I pulled the trigger and I was in the death's care with my beloved, she was innocent but I was guilty.<br>We rose together to the path she yelled at me, nothing was understandable, none of her voice was arriving to my ears,<br> I wanted to hear her voice or even her yells. She punished me but we both were like a ghost.We made it there, two colored ways,<br> like the life paths, she ran away from my sins.<br> I went to the dark one and when I got there, <br>I felt so comfortable for the first time in my life away from her.<br> That feeling inside of me was like the dark at night. I went back, recalling her, I couldn't leave her alone.<br>But everything didn't make sense to my head when I saw a knife."
